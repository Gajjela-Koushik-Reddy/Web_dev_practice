## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

In this project I learnt how to use Flexbox. Previously I used to Brutefore my way to find the perfect spot for the elements using padding and margins. I used flex box to move elements around in this project instead of bruteforcing padding and margin values.


### Continued development

I have to build some more projects to get comfortable with vanilla CSS and HTML. Then I want to move to React for front-end.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me for to learn most of my CSS and HTML contains resources that aid in web development.
