## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Reinforced my learnings of css flexbox from previous project. Did not try to bruteforce the items to put in place, instead I used flexbox to place the elements in the required positions.  


### Useful resources
